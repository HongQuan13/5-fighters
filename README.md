# 5 Fighters - AI-Powered CRM Chatbot

## Inspiration
Inspired by the potential of AI and machine learning (ML) to revolutionize Customer Relationship Management (CRM), we envisioned a tool that not only assists sales teams during live interactions but also optimizes the entire sales process through smart technology.

## What It Does
Our chatbot offers narrative recommendations based on the context of conversations and previous interactions, suggesting optimal responses to sales representatives. Additionally, it provides reminders for follow-ups and builds user portraits to enhance personalization and increase conversion rates.

## How We Built It
We developed our chatbot using a robust technology stack:
- **Backend:** Node.js for managing operations.
- **Frontend:** React.js to create a seamless user experience.
- **AI Integration:** We utilized OpenAI’s API for advanced generative AI capabilities.
- **Business Customization:** A secure file system allows users to store internal business rules, which our chatbot leverages to tailor and enhance its responses based on specific business needs.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- **Real-time Information Access:** Ensuring the chatbot had access to up-to-date information was a challenge due to the non-real-time nature of ChatGPT’s knowledge base. This could potentially result in outdated or misleading recommendations.
- **Real-time Recommendation System:** Developing a machine learning model capable of delivering accurate, real-time recommendations posed another complex issue. To address this, we integrated a real-time news search feature, allowing the chatbot to retrieve current events and updates for more accurate responses.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- **Customer Insights:** The chatbot’s ability to understand and predict customer needs effectively has shown potential to significantly improve user engagement and sales conversion rates.
- **Self-Adaptive AI:** Our system's ability to learn from interactions and improve over time without manual intervention marks a breakthrough in self-adaptive AI systems for sales processes.

## What We Learned
Through this project, we gained valuable insights into the deployment of AI solutions in real-world environments. Key lessons include:
- The importance of **data quality**.
- The need for **robust testing scenarios**.
- The significance of **user-centric design** in AI applications.

## What's Next for 5 Fighters
Moving forward, we plan to:
- Expand the chatbot’s capabilities to include **multilingual support**.
- Implement more advanced **predictive analytics**.
- Develop a **marketplace for AI-driven plugins**, allowing users to further customize and extend the chatbot’s functionality.
